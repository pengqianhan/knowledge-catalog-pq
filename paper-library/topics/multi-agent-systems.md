# Scope

This topic tracks papers where multiple agents coordinate reasoning, experimentation, or execution through shared state, task allocation, critique, or self-organization.

# Papers

* [Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems with Shared Context](../papers/2606.10662.md) - decentralized coordination through shared verified context and task queues.
* [AutoScientists](../papers/2605.28655.md) - self-organizing agent teams for long-running scientific experimentation.
* [Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Decentralized Memory](../papers/2605.22721.md) - per-agent dual-pool memory that outperforms centralized memory by up to 23.8% while cutting token usage by 49%.

# Synthesis

Two complementary decentralization strategies appear in this set: 2606.10662 (DeLM) decentralizes agents while keeping a single shared verified context, whereas 2605.22721 (DecentMem) keeps context centralized per-agent and decentralizes memory. The trade-off is coordination overhead vs. agent diversity — shared context enables tight coherence; per-agent memory preserves behavioral variation and reduces synchronization cost.

# Open Questions

* How should shared state be represented so agents can reuse it without creating integration bottlenecks?
* When is decentralized coordination better than a central planner?
* What safeguards are needed when multiple agents update durable knowledge artifacts?
* How do per-agent memory and shared-context approaches interact when combined in a single system?
